OpenVPN-auth-scrypt
===============
Authentication (`--auth-user-pass-verify`) [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) script 
for [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) that takes usernames and 
[scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) 
encrypted/hashed passwords from a text file.

## Introduction

## Usage

After setting up and configuring OpenVPN-auth-scrypt access can be managed by 
editing the text file with usernames and hashed passwords (VPN passwords file) 
in addition to certificates. For a user to be able to access VPN both a valid 
certificate and entry in VPN passwords file are required. Common name of the 
certificate must match username in VPN passwords file. To add a new entry to 
the file password hash must be generated by HTML form (`hashcalc.html`). The 
HTML form will display the line to be added to VPN passwords file. Hash also 
depends on the username provided (and on many of the settings configurable in 
`hashcalc.html` and `verify.pl`).
